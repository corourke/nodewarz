# nodewarz
Working on a node-hacking game with my teenage son.

### To Run Example

    $ npm install
    $ webpack
    
Then load index.html (The Redux DevTools extension will only work if the HTML file is loaded via HTTP.)

### To Do

* Flesh out tests.
* Do something better than all the helper functions. 
* Automate webpack and mocha tests
